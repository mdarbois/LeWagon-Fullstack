# Le Wagon Fullstack Web Development

At the end of the 9-week full-time intensive coding bootcamp, we had the opportunity to work in teams on two projects.

- one-week project building a clone of Airbnb:
[RentATool](https://airbnb-mdarbois-2df6fe8522d7.herokuapp.com)  
[Check the code here](https://github.com/mdarbois/Rent-a-tool)  

- two-weeks project building our own web app:
