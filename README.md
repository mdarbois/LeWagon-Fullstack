# LeWagon-fullstack

At the end of the 9-week full-time intensive coding bootcamp, we had the opportunity to work in teams on two projects.

- one-week project building a clone of Airbnb:

[Check the code here](https://github.com/mdarbois/LeWagon-fullstack/tree/main/Airbnb)  

- two-weeks project building our own web app:
[Cooking Mate](https://www.cookingmate.site)
